Quickstart
==========

screenpy-quickstart
-------------------

To set up
a Screenplay Pattern test suite
using ScreenPy,
you only need one command.
Open your Terminal and run::

    screenpy-quickstart

This will create ``ui``,
``tasks``,
and ``features`` directories,
filled with a simple test.

For an explanation of each of these directories,
see the :ref:`filehierarchy` page!
