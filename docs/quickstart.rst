Quickstart
==========

screenpy-quickstart
-------------------

To quickly set up a Screenplay Pattern test suite using ScreenPy,
``cd`` to the folder you will use for your suite
and run this command:

    screenpy-quickstart

This will set up ``user_interface``, ``tasks``, and ``features`` directories
and fill them with a simple test.

For an explanation of each of these directories,
see the :ref:`filehierarchy` page!
