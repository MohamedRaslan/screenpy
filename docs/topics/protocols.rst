Protocols
=========

ScreenPy uses Protocols
to enable "structure subclassing."
This means
a Question is only a Question
if it is :class:`~screenpy.core.protocols.Answerable`,
for example.

Note that :ref:`resolutions`
are the exception
to this subclassing strategy.
They use traditional inheritance
to take advantage of |PyHamcrest|'s matchers.

The following Protocols describe
Abilities,
Actions,
and Questions
through the methods they need.
