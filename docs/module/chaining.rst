Chaining
========

The |Chain| action
is a sort of meta-action
that can group many other actions into a series.
This is useful for those features
that require things like
clicking-and-dragging
or hovering.

Many of the included :ref:`actions` may be added to a Chain,
but some of the Actions are not chainable
and will raise an |UnableToAct|.
The Actions which can be chained
correspond to the methods of Selenium's |ActionChains| class.

Adding Actions to a Chain looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from screenpy.actions import Chain, Click, Hover

    from ..user_interface.homepage import HAMBURGER_MENU, SIGN_IN_LINK


    Perry.attempts_to(
        Chain(Hover.on_the(HAMBURGER_MENU), Click.on_the(SIGN_IN_LINK))
    )

If you write a custom Action
which should be able to be added to a Chain,
you must define an ``add_to_chain`` method
on your custom Action.
For more information,
refer to the :ref:`protocols` page.
