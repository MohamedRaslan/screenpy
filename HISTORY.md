Release History
===============

3.0.0 (2020-02-18)

### Breaking Changes

- **BrowseTheWeb** no longer has `.to_find()` or `.to_wait_for()`. I realized these methods actually break the S in SOLID, and these methods were limiting Actions from really doing what they're supposed to do. See the Improvements section below for the direct benefit of this change!

### Improvements

- **Wait** can now use strategies that don't use a target, or have multiple arguments. You can now use any of Selenium's URL-monitoring expected conditions or any other custom strategies through `Wait().using(strategy).with_("any", "number", "of", "args")`!
- **AddHeader** can now accept new forms of header-setting arguments, like a dict or just alternating pairs. Now `AddHeader(Cookie="yes=please")` == `AddHeader({"Cookie": "yes=please"})` == `AddHeader("Cookie", "yes=please")`!
- Added **SetHeaders** action, if you want to set the headers *exactly* (and remove all unmentioned headers).
- **AddHeader**, **SetHeaders**, and **Send\[METHOD\]Request** actions now all have a way to mark their contents as secret, so they won't be logged. Add a `.which_should_be_kept_secret()` or `.secretly()` to the end and the log won't mention the unmentionables.
- I did another docs overhaul, this time making them read in a way that might please [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).

### Bug Fixes

- **Click** is now able to be chained without a target to click. This was preventing clicking at an offset, which annoyed *me* at least.


2.2.0 (2020-11-29)
------------------

### Improvements

- Updated all the dependencies to support Python 3.9! Kind of a boring update.
- Made the reported actions more consistently worded.

2.1.0 (2020-09-03)
------------------

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `on_top` method from **SwitchToTab**, it wasn't consistent under certain circumstances and that could be misleading.
- Removed the **BaseAction**, **BaseAbility**, and **BaseQuestion** classes in favor of Protocols.

### New Features

- Added API testing support!
  - Added **MakeAPIRequests** ability.
  - Added **SendGETRequest**, **SendPOSTRequest**, **SendPATCHRequest**, **SendPUTRequest**, **SendOPTIONSRequest**, **SendHEADRequest**, **SendDELETERequest**, and **SendAPIRequest** actions.
  - Added **AddHeader**/**AddHeaders** action.
  - Added **Cookies**, **CookiesOnTheWebSession**, **CookiesOnTheAPISession** questions.
  - Added **StatusCodeOfTheLastResponse** question.
  - Added **BodyOfTheLastResponse** question.
  - Added **HeadersOfTheLastResponse** question.
  - Added **ContainsTheKey**, **ContainsTheValue**, **ContainsTheEntry** resolutions.
- Added `should_see_any_of` assertion method to Actors, which is similar to `should_see_the` but passes if *at least* one of its tests are true, instead of all of them.
- Added **HasLength** resolution, for fun.
- Added a "cookbook" section to the docs to give examples of common use-cases.

### Improvements:

- *Huge* docs overhaul, aimed at reducing word count and increasing word value.
- Switched to using Protocols for type hinting instead of base classes.
- **IsVisible** resolution now has a nicer mismatch message.

### Bugfixes:

- Fixed a timing issue with **has_method_with_return_value** where the return value could change by the time the mismatch message was being written to the log, which made it look like a passing test was failing.
- Fixed `SwitchTo.default()` logging a very metaphysical "{The Actor} switches to the None".
- Fixed **Enter**'s logging when `then_hits` is used to hit a key without a nice text representation (like "Return").
- Fixed a small collection of copy/paste errors in documentation and logged strings.

2.0.1 (2020-05-10)
------------------

### Improvements:

- Added try/except to the **Element** question so it will return `None` if the element doesn't exist, which enables `IsNot(Visible())` or `IsNot(EqualTo(None))` to test for non-visibility/presence of an element.
- Moved **BrowsingError** to `screenpy.exceptions` too, missed that one!


2.0.0 (2020-05-05)
------------------

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `.then_wait_for` methods from **Enter** and **Click**.
- Removed all `to_switch_to...` methods from **BrowseTheWeb**, preferring to use the browser directly. Also removed `to_visit` and `to_get` from **BrowseTheWeb** for the same reason.
- Changed **UnableToPerformError** and **UnableToActError** to **UnableToPerform** and **UnableToAct**.
- Moved **DeliveryError** and **TargetingError** to `screenpy.exceptions` (though you can still technically import them from `screenpy.actor` and `screenpy.target`).
- Removed several syntactic sugar options that, upon retrospect, aren't really grammatically possible in this module.

### New Features

- Added *so many* new actions!
  - Added **RefreshPage** action.
  - Added **GoBack** action.
  - Added **GoForward** action.
  - Added **SwitchToTab** action. (It turns out **SwitchTo** didn't quite switch to all the things you needed to switch to.)
  - Added **Chain** action, to do chained actions! Such as these:
    - Added **DoubleClick** action.
    - Added **RightClick** action.
    - Added **MoveMouse**/**Hover** action.
    - Added **HoldDown** action.
    - Added **Release** action.
- Enabled several existing actions to be chained with the new Chain action:
  - **Click**
  - **Enter**
  - **Enter2FAToken**
  - **Pause**
- Added **Element** question, to test things about a specific element, such as...
- Added **IsVisible** resolution, to test if an element is visible!
- You can now see the same detailed logs without the Allure report if you wish! All the action is now logged at INFO level. Try adding `--log-cli-level=INFO` to your `pytest` run, for example!

### Improvements

- Cleaned up a lot of documentation.
- Updated the `screenpy-quickstart` script to better reflect the current state and recommendations.

### Fixes

- Fixed a strange issue that prevented Allure from properly naming the acts and scenes in the Behavior view.

1.0.1 (2020-02-25)
------------------

### Improvements

- "Properly" typed ScreenPy. It could probably be done a little better, though.

1.0.0 (2020-02-17)
------------------

### New Features

- Added IOS and Android browser support! ðŸŽ‰ (Will add full Appium support later!)
- Added **Pause** action, for those times you *really* need it.
- Added **Debug** action, to drop a debugger in the middle of a chain of actions/tasks.
- Added **SwitchTo** action, to switch to iframes, back to the default frame, and whatever else you need to switch to.
- Added **AcceptAlert**/**DismissAlert**/**RespondToPrompt** to support any javascript alert actions you could want.

### Improvements

- Added a bunch of new syntactic sugar and default options.
- Added a new method to **Target** that will allow you to pass in your own locator tuple, like `Target.located((By.LINK_TEXT, "click me"))`
- Added additional logging to improve debugging experience.
- Added custom exceptions with exception chaining to provide more context when tests break.
- HUGE documentation improvement.
- Typed ScreenPy, and marked ScreenPy as being typed!

### Fixes

- Fixed strange grammar in logged resolution lines.

### Deprecations

- Deprecated the `then_wait_for` methods on **Click** and **Enter** now that we have a **Wait** class. These methods will be removed in 2.0.0.
